# App Meus Objetivos

My fifth app made with Dart/Flutter! ðŸš€

In it I learned about:
* How to connect the app with Firebase
* How to use Firestore to store real-time data
* How to use CircularProgressIndicator as feedback for user while request data from Firebase
* How to use ImagePicker
* How to persist locally the user login
* How to use CircleAvater to get a rounded profile picture
* How to use the LinearGradient to stylish the items in the list
